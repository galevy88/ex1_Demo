# Advenced_Exercises
This repo used for Advenced computing exercise

In this Excercise we have to make an implementation for 5 types of distances:
1. Euclidain Distance
2. Manheten Distance
3. Chebyshev Distance
4. Canberra Distance
5. Minkowski Distance

When you run the file you wil face an empty line for input there you will have the insert your vector input.
The insertation of the vector should be with spaces between the numbers like the following example:

The code will compute the distances and will send you the following output:

The order of the distances is the same as wrote in the README file

# IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:
1. Vector can be in any size but the size of the 2 vectors must be the same!
2. Vectors should contain integer only
3. Each number within each vector must be seperated with spaces - Only 1 Space seperate between 2 numbers!
4. The run of the program should be from the main.cpp file
5. You can't finish the imput you insert with space


# COMPILING AND RUNNING COMMANDS:
You should run the following commands in this order:
1. <code>git init</code>
2. <code>git clone https://github.com/galevy88/Advenced_Exercises.git</code>
3. Go inside the directory you just cloned (.cpp and .h files should appear)
4. <code>g++ header.h</code>
5. <code>g++ -std=c++11 Calculator.cpp main.cpp -o compiled_file</code>
6. <code>./compiled_file</code>
